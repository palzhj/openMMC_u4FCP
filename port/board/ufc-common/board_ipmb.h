 * @author Gokhan Sozmen
 *
 *  The state of each GA signal is represented by G (grounded), U (unconnected),
 *  or P (pulled up to Management Power).
 *
 *  The MMC drives P1 low and reads the GA lines. The MMC then drives P1 high and
 *  reads the GA lines. Any line that changes state between the two reads indicate
 *  an unconnected (U) pin.
 *
 *  The IPMB-L address of a Module can be calculated as (70h + Site Number x 2). <br>
 *  G = 0, P = 1, U = 2 <br>
